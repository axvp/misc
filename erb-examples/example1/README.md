### Inline ERB example
The file [example1.rb](./example1.rb) contains a very simple example for an inline ERB. The original can be found in this excellent [ERB introduction](http://apidock.com/ruby/ERB).

The example can be run using the command:

	ruby example1.rb

To get more information you can optionally use irb directly:

	irb example1.rb

The example creates a template directly in code and executes it.
